Round Bridge

Author: Excell

Description
I remember visiting this stunning coastal location with an unusual circular bridge, but I canâ€™t seem to recall
its name. Can you help me figure out where this place ! PS : Put the name of this place in the flag format
FLAG{*}, all in lowercase, and replace spaces with _. FLAG: FLAG{big_round_bridge}
