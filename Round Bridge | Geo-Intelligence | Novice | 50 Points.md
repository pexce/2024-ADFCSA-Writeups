## Description
>I remember visiting this stunning coastal location with an unusual circular bridge, but I canâ€™t seem to recall
its name. Can you help me figure out where this place ! PS : Put the name of this place in the flag format
FLAG{*}, all in lowercase, and replace spaces with _. FLAG: FLAG{big_round_bridge}



### 1. We are provided with the following image:

<img src="files/round_bridge.png" width="400"/>


### 2. Let's reverse image search this

<img src="files/Bridge.png" width="400"/>

### 3. **Therefore flag = FLAG{Laguna_Garzon_Bridge}**
