Description

** In the early days of the power grid in our suburb, an old cost calculator service was developed to help
manage energy expenses. This Python-based tool was once essential for calculating costs and guiding
resource allocation, but as newer, more advanced systems took over, it was forgottenâ€”left running quietly
in the background. Now a relic of days gone by, this legacy system still exists, waiting for someone to
uncover its secrets. Rumor has it that the biggest secrets are hidden in a file called flag.txt. Challenge Port:
1337 Flag Format: FLAG{EV4LUAT3_C0ST}


FLAG{3V4LU4T3D_5UCC35SFU11Y}

No longer have access to lab. But this was pretty easy. Was guided by Chat GPT as to which prompts I needed to use to query the python program and for it to retrieve flag.txt
